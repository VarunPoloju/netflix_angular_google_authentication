If u want google authentication usin angular there are many ays like installing packages and all but all those are not
working since google made those packages as deperecated, so we need to visit offical google documentation

https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/client-library --> copy the script tag and paste inside index.html

then visit https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference 

foe getting client id -> https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/new -> choose ur account

select a project -> give a name -> create ->select project

oauth consent screen -> external -> create -> app name(),email(), application home page(http://localhost:4200), developer contact info email add() -> save and continue

add or remove scopes -> check userinfoemail, userinfo profile, openid -> update -> save and continie - back to dashboard
